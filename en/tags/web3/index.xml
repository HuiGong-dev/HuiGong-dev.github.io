Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to restart in this new semester.
Here is my plan:
Learn how to create RESTful API from scratch Learn OAuth 2.0 (perhaps also JWT) Learn REACT basic Dive into React and build (at least one) full-stack React App Other than that I also want to learn more about web3 concepts.</description></item></channel></rss>
